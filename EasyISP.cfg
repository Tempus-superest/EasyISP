// This script enhances the efficiency of all engines and RCS modules in Kerbal Space Program by increasing their Specific Impulse (ISP). A higher ISP means better fuel efficiency. Multi mode engines are also supported.
// To adjust the efficiency boost, change the number in the lines '@k0 *= 5' and '@k1 *= 5' to any positive number you choose. For example, changing '5' to '10' will give ISP 10x greater than  default.
// Set the values to 1 to revert to the default ISP values.
