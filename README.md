# EasyISP Mod for Kerbal Space Program

## Introduction
EasyISP is a simple mod designed to increase the Specific Impulse (ISP) of all engines in Kerbal Space Program. This enhancement leads to greater fuel efficiency, allowing for longer missions or more aggressive maneuvers with the same amount of fuel. Create a near (or far) future space program with advanced capabilities. Create an "Expanse" like series of ships.

## Features
- Increases engine efficiency dramatically.
- Simple to install and use.
- Compatible with all versions of Kerbal Space Program.

1. Download the latest release of EasyISP.
2. Extract the downloaded file.
3. Move the `EasyISP` folder into the `GameData` directory of your Kerbal Space Program installation.
4. Start Kerbal Space Program and enjoy your enhanced engines!

## How to Use
Once installed, EasyISP automatically applies the ISP multiplier to all engine modules. There are no additional steps or configurations needed to start benefiting from increased engine efficiency.

## Customizing
To adjust the ISP multiplier:
1. Navigate to the `GameData/EasyISP` directory.
2. Open the `configuration.cfg` file with a text editor.
